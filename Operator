Retrieve the names of every customer who joined before ‘2022-03-25’

	SELECT * FROM cust_tbl where join_date < '2022-03-25';
	SELECT * FROM cust_tbl where join_date > '2022-03-25';
	SELECT * FROM cust_tbl where join_date = '2022-03-25';
	SELECT * FROM cust_tbl where join_date != '2022-03-25';
	SELECT * FROM cust_tbl where join_date >= '2022-03-25';
	SELECT * FROM cust_tbl where join_date <= '2022-03-25';

 List out every order made by “Kim.”

	select * from cust_tbl
	select * from ord_tbls

	   SELECT * FROM ord_tbls
   WHERE cust_id = (SELECT cust_id FROM cust_tbl WHERE cust_name = 'Kim');

   explaination--

  2 tables namely ord_tbls and cust_tbl
cust_id is in both tables
i am seelcting all records for customer id from cust table 
and in the sub query
i am selecting customer id from cust_tbl 


Step 1:
The query first looks in the cust_tbl table to find the customer ID of the person whose name is 'Kim'.

SELECT cust_id FROM cust_tbl WHERE cust_name = 'Kim';
Step 2:
It then takes that customer ID and uses it to look in the ord_tbls table to find all orders that have the same customer ID.
